/**
 * This lesson compares:
 * - Statically typed languages (e.g., TypeScript, C++)
 * - Dynamically typed languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python)
 * 
 * Static typing catches errors at compile-time, dynamic typing at run-time.
 * TypeScript helps prevent runtime issues by ensuring type correctness early.
