/**
 * This video introduces TypeScript:
 * - TS is a superset of JavaScript, developed by Microsoft.
 * - Adds static typing, interfaces, generics, decorators, and more.
 * - Requires compilation into JS (transpilation).
 * - Helps catch errors before runtime.
 * - All valid JS code is valid TS code.
 * - You just need basic JavaScript knowledge to start learning TS.
